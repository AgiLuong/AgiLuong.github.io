        <p>I'm broadly interested in systems work. An example I tell people is that I don't
            care too much about how AI/ML models run, but I would love to build infrastructure
            for them or write code that optimizes the training/inference process. I'm also
            an impatient human at heart so I love when things run fast.

        <p> The "move fast" culture is very real here. Everyone is incredibly smart and I'm 
            learning a lot just from talking to them.

        <p>Our work aims to help developers stop making the same errors that cause these bugs
            in the first place. It feels like static analysis but cooler.

        <p>I did research on accelerating regex matching using Hyperscan and GPU offloading.
            I was advised by <u><a class="item" href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/" target="_blank">Professor Kevin Skadron</a></u>
            and <u><a class="item" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tommy-tracy-ii-46244554/" target="_blank">Dr. Tommy Tracy II</a></u>.

        <p>This was my first experiece doing research. I am forever grateful for my advisors

        <p>I have been a TA since my first year at UVA. I love the work; I love interacting
            with students and come up with different ways to explain the same concept. 
        </p>
        <p>I have TA'ed for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CS 111x - Introducion to Programming (1 semester)</li>
            <li>CS 2130 - Computer Systems & Organization 1 (2 semesters)</li>
            <li>CS 3140 - Software Development Essentials (1 semester)</li>
            <li>CS 3130 - Computer Systems & Organization 2 (3 semesters)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The CS 2130 - 3130 sequence is my favorite. I was fortunate enough to be taught
            by <u><a class="item" href="https://luthert.web.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Professor Luther Tychonievich</a></u>
            in CS 2130. He is the best lecturer I've ever had in my life, and I think he prompted my interest in systems work.
